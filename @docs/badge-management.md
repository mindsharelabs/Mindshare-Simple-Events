## For Developers

If you were using any badge management hooks or functions from the Events plugin, they have been moved to the Make Member Plugin with the following changes:

### Old (Events Plugin)

```php
// Old action hook
do_action('mindevents_after_badge_toggled', $event_id, $sub_event_id, $user_id, $new_status, $badge_name);

// Old AJAX action
wp_ajax_mindevents_badge_toggle
```

### New (Make Member Plugin)

```php
// New action hook
do_action('make_after_badge_toggled', $user_id, $cert_id, $new_status, $badge_name);

// New AJAX action
wp_ajax_make_badge_toggle
```

## Next Steps

1. Update any custom code that relied on Events plugin badge functionality
2. Test badge operations in the new Make Member Plugin implementation

### Original Overview

The Badge Management System allowed administrators to award existing badges/certificates to attendees of Badge Class events. This system integrated with the existing `certs` custom post type and user profile custom fields to provide a unified badge management workflow.

### Original Key Features

1. **Automatic Badge Class Detection** - Events were automatically identified as "Badge Classes" if they had a category containing the word "badge"
2. **Badge/Certificate Selection** - Badge Management Meta Box appeared in the side column for Badge Class events
3. **Unified Badge Display and Management** - Single "Badges" column showed attendee's current badges AND provided award/remove functionality
4. **Direct Profile Integration** - Badge awards were added directly to user profiles

### Original Technical Implementation

The system worked with:

- **Events**: `badge_cert_id` meta field stored selected certificate
- **Users**: ACF `certs` field stored user's certificates
- **Certificates**: `certs` custom post type for available badges

### Original Files (Now Cleaned Up)

- `inc/admin.class.php` - Badge management meta box and unified attendee display
- `inc/ajax.class.php` - AJAX handler for certificate management
- `js/admin.js` - Client-side certificate toggle interactions
- `css/style.css` - Badge-specific styling
